# nft-music-license
NFT-bound music license template for sync/master use and unlockable content.

### What is this?
This is a template repo of a template license you can clone and edit as you wish.

### Who is this for?
This license was created for artists who want to add some blockchain magic to their digitally unique assets. 

You can now give owners of your NFTs special privileges such as access to stems and even legal ones like commercial use of your music. Combine this with different tiers of access to add onto an item's rarity, gift your music to your grandma, the sky is the limit.

### Why?
Why not?

### Who are you?
Definitely not a lawyer. Critiques, advices, corrections and contributions are welcome - use the "Discussion" tab or submit a PR - and use at your own risk and judgement.

## How do I use this?
You can choose either the [Markdown](https://github.com/canokaue/nft-music-license#-canok-music-license-v01-), [Word Document](https://github.com/canokaue/nft-music-license/blob/main/canokml_template.docx), [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FcKZqoY-uug9LSyQuwrYRFcXhCorQbzpZxDQ07zOXc8/edit?usp=sharing) (please don't ask for edit access, make a copy instead) or [Plain Text](https://github.com/canokaue/nft-music-license/blob/main/LICENSE) version. Replace the {{double curly}} variables with the ones that fit you case and voila. You can check the ones I use over at the examples/ folder. 

If you've cloned this repo, then you're basically set - copy the link to the license file and set it as "unlockable contentent" in your NFT Marketplace of choice.

I do recommend you use an IPFS pinning service to distribute you files though.
